Total annual number of deaths from cancers (termed 'Neoplasms' within the IHME, Global Burden of Disease Study). This measures cancer deaths across both sexes and all ages.

Smaller categories of cancer types have been grouped by Our World in Data into a collective category 'Other cancers'. This grouping was set based on cancer types with global annual deaths in 2016 under 100,000. This includes testicular, Hodgkin lymphoma, mesothelioma, thyroid, non-melanoma skin cancer, nasopharynx, malignant skin melanoma, uterine cancer, and multiple myeloma.
