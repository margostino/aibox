It is designed to be used by humans to interact with the language. This means you don’t have to manually add query strings to URLs, or form-encode your POST data. Don’t worry if that made no sense to you. It will in due time.What can Requests do?Requests will allow you to send HTTP/1.1 requests using Python. With it, you can add content like headers, form data, multipart files, and parameters via simple Python libraries. It also allows you to access the response data of Python in the same way.In programming, a library is a collection or pre-configured selection of routines, functions, and operations that a program can use. These elements are often referred to as modules, and stored in object format.Libraries are important, because you load a module and take advantage of everything it offers without explicitly linking to every program that relies on them. They are truly standalone, so you can build your own programs with them and yet they remain separate from other programs.Think of modules as a sort of code template.To reiterate, Requests is a Python library.How to Install RequestsThe good news is that there are a few ways to install the Requests library. To see the full list of options at your disposal, you can view the official install documentation for Requests here.You can make use of pip, easy_install, or tarball.If you’d rather work with source code, you can get that on GitHub, as well.For the purpose of this guide, we are going to use pip to install the library.In your Python interpreter, type the following:pip install requests Importing the Requests ModuleTo work with the Requests library in Python, you must import the appropriate module. You can do this simply by adding the following code at the beginning of your script:import requests Of course, to do any of this – installing the library included – you need to download the necessary package first and have it accessible to the interpreter.Making a RequestWhen you ping a website or portal for information this is called making a request. That is exactly what the Requests library has been designed to do.To get a webpage you would do something like the following:r = requests.get(‘https://github.com/timeline.json’)Working with Response CodeBefore you can do anything with a website or URL in Python, it’s a good idea to check the current status code of said portal. You can do this with the dictionary look-up object.r = requests.get('https://github.com/timeline.json')\n",
      "r.status_code\n",
      ">>200\n",
      " \n",

The encoding that is guessed will be used when you access the r.text file.Through this file, you can discern what encoding the Requests library is using, and change it if need be.

      "Eager to get started? This page gives a good introduction in how to get started\n",
      "with Requests.\n",
      "First, make sure that:\n",
      "\n",
      "Requests is installed\n",
      "Requests is up-to-date\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s get started with some simple examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "Make a Request¶\n",
      "Making a request with Requests is very simple.\n",
      "Begin by importing the Requests module:\n",
      ">>> import requests\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let’s try to get a webpage. For this example, let’s get GitHub’s public\n",
      "timeline:\n",
      ">>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/events')\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we have a Response object called r. We can\n",
      "get all the information we need from this object.\n",
      "Requests’ simple API means that all forms of HTTP request are as obvious. For\n",
      "example, this is how you make an HTTP POST request:\n",
      ">>> r = requests.post('https://httpbin.org/post', data={'key': 'value'})\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nice, right? What about the other HTTP request types: PUT, DELETE, HEAD and\n",
      "OPTIONS? These are all just as simple:\n",
      ">>> r = requests.put('https://httpbin.org/put', data={'key': 'value'})\n",
      ">>> r = requests.delete('https://httpbin.org/delete')\n",
      ">>> r = requests.head('https://httpbin.org/get')\n",
      ">>> r = requests.options('https://httpbin.org/get')\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s all well and good, but it’s also only the start of what Requests can\n",
      "do.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Passing Parameters In URLs¶\n",
      "You often want to send some sort of data in the URL’s query string. If\n",
      "you were constructing the URL by hand, this data would be given as key/value\n",
      "pairs in the URL after a question mark, e.g. httpbin.org/get?key=val.\n",
      "Requests allows you to provide these arguments as a dictionary of strings,\n",
      "using the params keyword argument. As an example, if you wanted to pass\n",
      "key1=value1 and key2=value2 to httpbin.org/get, you would use the\n",
      "following code:\n",
      ">>> payload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}\n",
      ">>> r = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/get', params=payload)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You can see that the URL has been correctly encoded by printing the URL:\n",
      ">>> print(r.url)\n",
      "https://httpbin.org/get?key2=value2&key1=value1\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Content-Length headers will be overridden when we can determine the length of the content.\n",

      "Furthermore, Requests does not change its behavior at all based on which custom headers are specified. The headers are simply passed on into the final request.\n",
